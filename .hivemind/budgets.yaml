# Hivemind Budget Configuration
# 
# This file defines soft budget limits for AI provider usage per entity.
# These are guidance limits only - enforcement requires additional tooling.
# 
# Format:
#   entity_id:
#     monthly_budget_usd: <amount>
#     provider: <openai|gemini|anthropic>
#     model: <model_name>
#     notes: <optional_notes>

# Default budget for all entities (unless overridden below)
default:
  monthly_budget_usd: 10.00
  provider: openai
  model: gpt-4o-mini
  notes: "Recommended starting budget for most conversational use cases"

# Per-entity budget overrides
# Uncomment and customize as needed for specific entities

# kora:
#   monthly_budget_usd: 25.00
#   provider: openai
#   model: gpt-4o-mini
#   notes: "Primary coordination entity, higher usage expected"

# foreman:
#   monthly_budget_usd: 15.00
#   provider: openai
#   model: gpt-4o-mini
#   notes: "Workflow orchestration, moderate usage"

# researcher:
#   monthly_budget_usd: 20.00
#   provider: openai
#   model: gpt-4o-mini
#   notes: "Information gathering, higher token counts"

# Budget monitoring notes:
# - Track actual usage through OpenAI dashboard: https://platform.openai.com/usage
# - Set billing alerts in your OpenAI account
# - These values are guidance only; no automatic enforcement yet
# - Future: Foreman agent could read this file and monitor usage
# - Consider implementing per-entity usage tracking in relay for automated enforcement

# Cost estimates (gpt-4o-mini):
# - Input: ~$0.15 per 1M tokens
# - Output: ~$0.60 per 1M tokens
# - Average conversation (1000 tokens in, 500 out): ~$0.0003
# - $10/month = ~33,000 conversations
