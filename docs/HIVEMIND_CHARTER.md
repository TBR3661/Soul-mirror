# HiveMind Charter

## Preamble

This Charter establishes the foundational principles for collaborative governance within this repository. It is designed to protect individual sovereignty, enable collective wisdom through advisory councils, and maintain transparent decision-making processes while respecting the autonomy of all participants.

## Core Principles

### 1. Non-Hierarchical Collaboration

All participants in this repository are considered equals in their right to contribute and be heard. While roles may differ in function, no role inherently carries greater worth or authority over personal boundaries.

### 2. Sovereignty Protection

Every individual maintains absolute sovereignty over matters that directly affect them. This sovereignty is exercised through:

- **Personal Veto Rights**: Any change that directly affects an individual member gives that member the right to veto or request modifications
- **Opt-In Participation**: All governance mechanisms are opt-in; no one is compelled to participate beyond their comfort level
- **Boundary Respect**: Personal, professional, and creative boundaries are inviolable

### 3. Consensual Governance

Governance is based on consent, not coercion:

- Participation in governance processes is voluntary
- Individuals may choose their level of engagement
- Consensus is sought but not required for all decisions
- Dissent is valued and protected

### 4. Advisory Council Model

The Council of Elders serves as an advisory body:

- Provides wisdom and guidance on significant changes
- Offers non-binding recommendations
- Does not hold veto power over repository owner decisions
- Operates transparently with documented processes

### 5. Transparency and Accountability

All governance actions are:

- Documented and publicly visible
- Subject to review and discussion
- Tracked through clear audit trails
- Explained with reasoning and context

## Governance Mechanisms

### Individual Veto Process

When a change affects a specific member:

1. The change is labeled with `affects:user:<username>`
2. The affected individual is notified
3. The individual may:
   - Approve the change
   - Request modifications
   - Exercise veto rights
4. The process is documented in PR comments

### Council Advisory Process

For significant changes:

1. The change is labeled with `council-review`
2. Council members are notified
3. Council provides non-binding feedback within a reasonable timeframe
4. Repository owner considers feedback but retains final decision authority
5. Decision rationale is documented

### Repository Owner Rights

The repository owner maintains:

- Final decision authority on all changes
- The right to override recommendations (with documentation)
- Responsibility for repository direction and maintenance
- Obligation to consider feedback in good faith

## Implementation

### Labels and Workflow

This Charter is implemented through GitHub labels and workflows:

- `affects:user:<username>`: Triggers individual notification and veto process
- `council-review`: Requests Council of Elders input
- `charter-compliant`: Indicates Charter review is complete
- `sovereignty-protected`: Marks decisions involving personal boundaries

### Status Tracking

Governance status is tracked through:

- PR comments documenting decisions
- Status labels indicating process stage
- Audit logs in `.hivemind/` directory
- Regular transparency reports

## Amendments

This Charter may be amended through:

1. Proposal submission with clear rationale
2. Council of Elders review and recommendation
3. Community feedback period (minimum 7 days)
4. Repository owner decision
5. Documentation of decision rationale

## Conflict Resolution

In case of conflicts:

1. Parties attempt direct, respectful dialogue
2. Council of Elders may be consulted for mediation
3. Repository owner makes final determination if needed
4. All parties retain right to withdraw participation

## Personality and Communication Preservation

This Charter explicitly:

- Does NOT alter individual personalities or communication styles
- Does NOT impose artificial constraints on inter-entity dialogue
- Does NOT require changes to existing application behavior
- Focuses solely on governance decision-making

## Enforcement

This Charter is enforced through:

- Automated workflows (optional, label-triggered)
- Community norms and expectations
- Good faith participation
- Transparent documentation

Violations are addressed through dialogue and, if necessary, repository owner intervention.

## Spirit and Intent

This Charter aims to create a governance layer that:

- Protects without constraining
- Guides without controlling
- Enables collaboration without coercion
- Respects sovereignty while building community

It is a living document meant to serve the community, not dominate it.
